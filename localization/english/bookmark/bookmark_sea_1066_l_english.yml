But she secluded herself to be a Bhikkuni, putting the next eldest, Samarawijaya, as the next heir to the throne. In the end, Maharaja Airlangga split the kingdom in two, and Samarawijaya ended up inheriting the Kingdom of Panjalu. \n\n#bold Will you respect your father's wishes or will you claim your rightful place as the Maharaja of a reunited Java? #!"

  bm_1066_sea_china_desc:0 "The Song dynasty emerged in the year 960 out of the chaos left by the collapse of the Tang, managing to reunite most of the empire by 979, though with the loss of some territories to the Xia, Liao, and Dai Viet, the most significant of which were the Sixteen Prefectures taken by the Khitans. Much back-and-forth fighting continued until the signing of the Chanyuan Treaty, which had the Song provide a yearly tribute to the Liao, as well as recognition as diplomatic equals. With this peace secured, the two empires are now free to deal with other matters.\n\n#bold Two Sons of Heaven now reign in the East. Will this peace last, or will one - or even a newcomer - manage to dominate the others? #!"

  bookmark_sea_china_liao_desc:0 "The Khitan State has seen great successes in the last century; though China has been reunited under the Song emperor, the Khitans have managed to maintain both control of the strategic Sixteen Prefectures and a tenuous peace with the Song through the Chanyuan Treaty.\n\nWith the southern border more or less secure, the pertinent threats are now those from other neighboring steppe tribes, and Liao's own internal struggles. The Han and Khitan populations both seek greater influence within government, and finding the proper balance will be Emperor Hongji's greatest challenge.\n\n#bold Can you maintain internal peace within Liao, or will the diverse factions rip the empire apart? #!"

Cordial relations are maintained with Pagan to the east despite their expansionism, while those with Dai Viet, though marred by a few incidents along the border, are generally peaceful.\n\n#bold Dali is currently enjoying a period of peace and prosperity.

What was formerly but a large city-state was now the mightiest polity yet seen in the Irrawaddy Valley, and the second-largest empire in Mainland Southeast Asia - behind only the neighboring Khmers. A convert from Ari to Theravada Buddhism, Anawrahta also built many pagodas across the empire, allowing for a flourishing of the religion otherwise in decline in both Southeast Asia and India.\n\n#bold Anawrahta's reign marks the beginning of a great empire, but such successes create many enemies.
