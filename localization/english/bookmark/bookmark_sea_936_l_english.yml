 bm_936_sea_five_dynasties_desc:0 "Already in decline, the Huang Chao rebellion was the final blow that ended central authority in the Tang Dynasty. The final Emperor Ai, merely a young boy, was forced to abdicate to Zhu Wen in 907, who established the Liang Dynasty. Liang was in turn usurped by a "restored" Tang under Li Cunxu in 923. The fourth emperor of this Later Tang Dynasty, Li Congke, now faces rebellion in the form of Shi Jingtang and his ally, the ascendant Khitan Empire.\n\n#bold Five Dynasties ruled Northern China before the Song managed to reunify the shattered empire. Can you bring an end to this civil war or is the Middle Kingdom doomed to chaos?#!"

 bookmark_five_dynasties_jin_desc:0 "Shi Jingtang rose to notoriety as an officer under Li Siyuan, at the time a general for his brother Li Cunxu, the Prince of Jin. Shi so impressed Li Siyuan that he was offered Li's daughter in marriage, tying him to the future emperors.\n\nBy 936, Li Siyuan's adopted son Li Congke had become the Emperor of the Later Tang, and despite their familial bond general Shi and Emperor Li had grown distrustful and fearful of one another. After a number of exchanges Emperor Li decided to have Shi stripped of his titles and ordered his sons and brother killed. Shi sent for aid from the Khitan Khagan Yarüd Ñaugu, promising the Sixteen Prefectures if they would support him as Emperor.\n\n#bold The stage is set, and the combined armies of Shi and Khitan march against the Later Tang. Will you lead them to victory against your vengeful brother-in-law or is this revolt doomed to failure?#!"

With the Celestial Empire fractured and fighting amongst themselves, a unique opportunity has presented itself: Ñaugu has decided to support the revolt of Shi Jingtang, in the hope of securing a favorable relationship with the future ruler of the Central Plain.\n\n#bold Will you uphold the legacy of your father, or will the empire fall as quickly as it appeared?#!"

 bookmark_five_dynasties_jeongan_desc:0 "After Balhae was conquered by the Khitans, a noble by the name of Yeol Man-hwa led a coup, toppling the Dae clan and setting up his own kingdom of Jeongan. While the Khitans are occupied with the Celestial Empire to the south, it is only a matter of time before they return to reassert their influence over the former lands of Balhae. \n\n#bold Will you be able to maintain your independence, or will Jeongan suffer the same fate as its predecessor?#!"

 bookmark_five_dynasties_goryeo_desc:0 "Wang Geon emerged out of the Later Three Kingdoms period as ruler of a unified Goryeo, the second dynasty to rule over the entire Korean peninsula.

 bookmark_five_dynasties_tang_desc:0 "An adopted son of the second Emperor of Later Tang, Li Siyuan, Li Congke came to power after rebelling against his brother Li Conghou. Though a reasonably competent ruler, his reign is nevertheless plagued by Khitan raids and natural disasters, calling into question his legitimacy for the Mandate of Heaven. Support has grown for his brother-in-law and rival, Shi Jingtang, and so the Emperor had Shi ordered to move from Hedong to Taiping. This only exascerbates Shi's own fears however, and now Shi rises in rebellion against his brother-in-law, with the aid of the Khitans in the north.\n\n#bold Li Congke's reign has been brief, and it may be about to be cut even shorter. Can you defeat your brother-in-law and keep the name of Tang alive, or will you allow him to supplant you as Emperor? #!"

 bm_936_sea_ten_kingdoms_desc:0 "While the north fights for dominance over the Central Plain, a number of defacto independent states rule over the south.

This has repeated with Datianxing, and again with Dayining. The governor of Tonghai, Duan Siping, is feared by Emperor Yang Zhao, and has been ordered to be imprisoned and executed. Duan managed to escape, however, and has gathered an army to overthrow Yang Zhao.\n\n#bold Duan Siping was the founder of Dali, a mighty kingdom which survived for three centuries before its destruction by the Mongols.

 bookmark_ten_kingdoms_han_desc:0 "Previously a Jiedushi of Qinghai Circuit, Liu Yan declared himself Emperor of Yue in 917, but soon thereafter changed the name to Han, as his family name was the same as that of the Han Dynasty Emperors. Liu Yan fought frequently against neighboring states, briefly capturing Annam before losing it to Dương Đình Nghệ. But Liu Yan does not surrender easily, and another invasion has been ordered in the hopes of permanently reclaiming Annam.\n\n#bold Can you meet Liu Yan's ambitions and forge a new southern empire, or is the Southern Han only destined for failure? #!"
