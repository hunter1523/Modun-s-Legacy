 circassian_decision_conversion_return_desc:0 "It's odd... We [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNounNoTooltip] have been calling our gods by foreign names from foreign nations. Naturally, such nonsense cannot continue—we will return calling our gods by their original [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetNameNoTooltip] names!"
 
 circassian_decision_1_desc:0 "When the foreigners first told us of a god called Jesus, we understood that there lies some wisdom in their words. But nowadays, they come and try to tell us what to do, that there is only one God and nature is not to be worshipped... Do they think we will shame our ancestors this easily? Everyone knows that Jesus and the Holy Mother are revered as the heads of a pantheon consisting of thousands of deities."

 circassian_decision_thamade_desc:0 "Ancient custom among Northern Caucasians dictates that there must always be wise elders to guide the people. These elders, whom we call $trait_thamade$s, are individuals who have led honorable lives and reached a certain age, and their wisdom is highly respected: one word from their mouths can end entire wars. It seems that now, people are looking to me to fulfill this role. It is a great honor, and I believe it's time for me to accept this responsibility and fulfill my duties for the betterment of the community."

 circassian_decision_seven_desc:0 "The legends are clear that we Ubykhs have ancient common roots with Circassians and Abkhazians. This is supported by the fact that we speak languages that are related. Over time, we have become so intertwined with the Circassians that many of us now speak Circassian fluently and even identify as Circassians, and outsiders can't really the difference between us. It could be beneficial to strengthen our bond with the Circassian community by fully embracing the identity for ourselves."

 circassian_decision_eight_desc:0 "While we identify as Christians and hold reverence for Jesus, outsiders are often surprised to witness our worship of other deities and engagement in ancient rituals. Clergymen from Constantinople and Rome frequently label our beliefs as heretical. While their criticism of our wisdom is laughable, it's undeniable that followers of Rome and Constantinople wield considerable power and could offer us valuable alliances. Perhaps it's worth considering abandoning our old traditions and fully embracing what is perceived as "true" Christianity."

 circassian_decision_nine_desc:0 "Lately, there has been growing interaction between our people and the Armenians, or the Jərməlı as we call them, who hail from a country in the south. Their merchants persist in frequenting our territories for trade. Moreover, there have been some cases where Armenians, fleeing feuds or other disturbances, sought sanctuary in our lands, forming small communities of skilled artisans. There is much we disagree on, but we can agree that we all love money. Perhaps we should enhance our collaboration by formally inviting more Armenians to settle in our territories, fostering mutual prosperity."

 circassian_decision_ten_desc:0 "Some years ago, young men from far away lands came to our lands preaching their strange religion which they call "Islam", outregiously denying the power of our gods. Obviously they were laughed at, but they kept operating in the shadows and even gained a small following, which only grew with merchants who share their religion coming to our lands for business. My ancestors could have thought that this was tolerable, but can I really allow such heresy to spread in my lands?"
