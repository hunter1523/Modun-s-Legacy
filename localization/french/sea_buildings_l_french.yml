  building_type_prambanan_temple_01_desc:0 "The Prambanan Temple is dedicated to the Trimūrti, the Hindu deities Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva and is one of the largest Hindu temples in Southeast Asia. The temple design is based on traditional Vastu Shastra, the architecture of Hinduism. The larger complex is separated into three zones, Bhurloka, representing the realm of mortals and demons, Bhuvarloka, representing the middle realm of holy people and lesser gods, and Svarloka, representing the highest and holiest realm, with the jewel-like pinnacle of the temple, the Prambanan’s Ratna representing indestructibility."

  building_type_borobudur_temple_01_desc:0 "The Borobudur Temple, made of nine stacked platforms, topped by many Stupas and panels depicting the life of Buddha, is iconic of Indonesia. The Mandala-shaped design follows Javanese Buddhiste architecture blending the Javanese concepts of ancestor worship and Buddhiste Nirvana. The step-pyramid base serves as a reminder of the mountain abodes of ancestral spirits, the three divisions symbolic of Buddhiste cosmology, the realm of desires at the base, the realm of forms in the middle, and at the pinnacle, the formless realm."
