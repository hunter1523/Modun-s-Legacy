C'est une histoire de luxure, d'intrigue, d'ambition et d'une lame magique.  C'est aussi une leçon de malédiction et de karma. Voulez-vous écouter ce conte et en tirer toute la sagesse possible ?"

De nombreuses personnes ont été envoyées pour l'attraper, mais aucune n'a réussi.\n\n Un jour, Ken Angrok a rencontré Mpu Lohgawe, un rishi indien qui lui a patiemment appris à abandonner sa vie de pécheur et à commencer une nouvelle vie. Lohgawe a proclamé qu'Arok était un avatar de Vishnu. Ses efforts ont été couronnés de succès et, plus tard, il a réussi à faire de Ken Angrok un assistant de [tunggul_ametung.GetFullName], un puissant chef régional du Tumapel."

Legend says when the wind blew over her dress and revealed her legs, Ken Angrok said that he saw a beautiful light shining. He later told this to his teacher, who stated that it was a sign that Ken Umang would bear a royal dynasty and any man that took her as wife would be a King. Ken Angrok, already infatuated by her beauty, became even more eager to take her by any means-—including killing Tunggul Ametung if necessary."

Thus, [ken_angrok.GetFirstName] needed an exceptionally strong weapon to defeat him, and also had to find a way to do so without himself being punished for the crime. He managed to get this by ordering a kris from a famous smith called [mpu_gandring.GetFirstName]. However the kris casting took a very long time. After several months, an impatient Ken Angrok visited Mpu Gandring to check on the kris's progress. He saw that the kris had already taken shape and was strong enough to be called an exceptional weapon. However, Mpu Gandring stated that he still needed several months to perform rituals to imbue the kris with more magical power, not only to make it strong but also to prevent it from becoming an evil weapon."

With his last breath, [mpu_gandring.GetFirstName] famously cursed Ken Angrok, foretelling that he himself and seven generations of his descendants would be killed by that cursed kris."

It wasn't long when almost everyone in Tumapel knew about the kris."

In the morning, everyone in Tumapel was shocked to hear of Tunggul Ametung's death. When they found the kris, they accused Kebo Ijo of being the assassin, just as Ken Angrok had planned. Before Kebo Ijo was able to defend himself, Ken Angrok stabbed him to death, on the pretext of revenging Tunggul Ametung."

One day, after finding out the truth, he went after and killed Ken Angrok. Legend says that Anusapati used the kris of [mpu_gandring.GetFirstName] to kill Ken Angrok; the same kris that Ken Angrok used to kill Tunggul Ametung and thus fulfilling the beginning of Mpu Gandring's curse. In the end, Anusapati was also killed by his stepbrother, [panji_tohajaya.GetFirstName] with the same kris. The Kings of Singhasari and Mataram are still descendants of Ken Angrok.\n\nThe fate of the Cursed Kris of Mpu Gandring is shrouded in mystery."
