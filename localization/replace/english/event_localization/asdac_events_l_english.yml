 LT.0003.desc:0 "The traitorous Duke Giselbert of Lorraine left our service after the death of our esteemed father King Henry. Now they have turned to the protection of the Karlings in West Francia, asking them for aid against us.\n\nNot only have they forsaken their ancient service to our rule, but our spies tells us Giselbert has been conspiring with traitorous lords of the realm.

The great legacy of the Romans and their descendants have been shattered by the civil wars and the chaos of the last decades.\n\nNow many of the minor Italian lords under his leadership have sent us emissaries asking for aid. They supposedly miss the days when they were under our distant rule. If we want to raise the banners of Charlemagne once more, the Kingdom of Italy will be essential in securing our recognition as true descendants of his empire."

 LT.0013.b:0 "Interesting..."

 middle_europe_decisions.0001.desc:0 "For a long time, the cities around the central Alps have been threatened by other actors inside the Empire. United under a single banner, they have now forged mutually beneficial alliances and have received the honor of imperial immediacy. \n\nIn honor of my dynasty's contributions to the Swiss city-states, I have been chosen as the head of this union, the one who will be the figurehead of all the Cantons of our new Swiss Confederacy. No longer will we be threatened by outsiders, but instead rise as a strong independent actor in the Empire."
 middle_europe_decisions.0002.desc.emperor:0 "After years of strife and uneasy diplomatic deals, I was forced to grant the Swiss Cantons imperial immediacy.\n\nThis collection of alpine towns has united in a large Confederacy to protect themselves from the predations of the Burgundians and the German lords. I must be careful to keep them in check, lest their accomplishment sow dissent amongst the neighboring burghers."
 middle_europe_decisions.0002.desc.vassals:0 "A new entity known as the Swiss Confederacy has risen in the Empire. They are a conglomeration of cities with imperial immediacy settled around the central Alps, and they have entered a defensive alliance to protect themselves from the other electors around them.\n\nAn independent force to be reckoned with, they have broken free from any prior claims to their lands, be it from the old Burgundians to the west or the German lords to the north.\n\nI should look out for this new potential threat in the Empire."
