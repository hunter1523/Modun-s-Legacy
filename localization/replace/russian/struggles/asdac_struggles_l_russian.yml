 asdac_byzantine_struggle: "Romanian Struggle"
 asdac_byzantine_struggle_desc: "The Romanian Struggle depicts the chaos in the region of Romania, i.e. the lands of the former Byzantine Empire, after the Fourth Crusade. The [struggle|E] shifts between [struggle_phase_phases|E] of hate-fueled violence, wary truces, and pragmatic cooperation. There are few permanent allies in such a situation, and [rulers|E] should be wary of relying purely on a shared [faith|E] or [culture|E]."
 #Phases
 struggle_byzantine_phase_opportunity: "$struggle_iberia_phase_opportunity$"
 struggle_byzantine_phase_opportunity_desc: "After a long period of relatively peaceful coexistence during the [struggle_phase_byzantine_conciliation|E], complacency begins to set in. Peasantry and nobility alike are comfortable that things just #EMP work#!, allowing more shrewd [characters|E] to take advantage of their naivety.\n\nEventually, fresh abuses will either cause an escalation into the [struggle_phase_byzantine_hostility|E], or else savvy politicking reaches an uneasy equilibrium through the [struggle_phase_byzantine_conciliation|E]."
 struggle_byzantine_phase_hostility: "$struggle_iberia_phase_hostility$"
 struggle_byzantine_phase_hostility_desc: "$Tensions flare and tempers fray in this phase. Repeated acts of malice and escalated misunderstandings during  the [struggle_phase_byzantine_opportunity|E] have lead to rising hatred of [characters|E] with differing [cultures|E], [faiths|E], or #EMP worse#!: both.\n\nSuch bloodshed cannot persist forever, though. Eventually, either cooler heads or simple exhaustion bring the peninsula to the [struggle_phase_byzantine_compromise|E].$"
 struggle_byzantine_phase_compromise: "$struggle_iberia_phase_compromise$"
 struggle_byzantine_phase_compromise_desc: "Whether through sickness with the strife of the [struggle_phase_byzantine_hostility|E] or deft escalation during the [struggle_phase_byzantine_conciliation|E], the $game_concept_struggle_phase_byzantine_compromise$ represents a growing accommodation between the peoples of Romania. Differences fall by the wayside and shared history and heritage binds former foes together.\n\nThe peninsula stands at a cross-roads: if conflicts reappear, then the [struggle_phase_byzantine_opportunity|E] awaits."
 struggle_byzantine_phase_conciliation: "$struggle_iberia_phase_conciliation$"
 struggle_byzantine_phase_conciliation_desc: "The product of a notable [struggle_phase_byzantine_compromise|E], during this phase, relations between the peoples of Romania grow so cordial that outsiders find their permissiveness difficult to parse. Inter-[faith|E] [marriages|E] are particularly common.\n\nThis can't last forever, though, and abuses of trust will eventually bring the [byzantine_struggle|E] back around to the [struggle_phase_byzantine_compromise|E]."
