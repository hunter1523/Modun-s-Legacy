Like St. Thomas the Apostle, I have brought the word of God to the East.\n\nBut what is to become of the many Christian beliefs in my realm? If we are to survive, then there must be unity, but unity under whom?"

 south_asia.0045.desc:0 "Long have the Christians of India been disunited and left astray under heathen rulers, but today a new unified Nasrani Church of St. Thomas has formed, with my chaplain, [new_priest.GetNameNoTier] appointed as its $indian_catholic_religious_head_title$. Though there remain differences between the different people who now are in communion with our church, we have cemented our church as the light of Christ in India."
