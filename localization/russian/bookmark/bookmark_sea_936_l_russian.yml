The final Император Ai, merely a young boy, was forced to abdicate to Zhu Wen in 907, who established the Liang Dynasty. Liang was in turn usurped by a "restored" Tang under Ли Cunxu in 923. The fourth emperor of this Later Tang Dynasty, Ли Congke, now faces rebellion in the form of Ши Цзинтан and his ally, the ascendant Khitan Империя.\n\n#bold Five Dynasties ruled Northern China before the Song managed to reunify the shattered empire.

Shi so impressed Ли Siyuan that he was offered Ли's daughter in marriage, tying him to the future emperors.\n\nBy 936, Ли Siyuan's adopted son Ли Congke had become the Император of the Later Tang, and despite their familial bond general Shi and Император Ли had grown distrustful and fearful of one another. After a number of exchanges Император Ли decided to have Shi stripped of his titles and ordered his sons and brother killed. Shi sent for aid from the Khitan Khagan Yarüd Ñaugu, promising the Sixteen Prefectures if they would support him as Император.\n\n#bold The stage is set, and the combined armies of Shi and Khitan march against the Later Tang. Will you lead them to victory against your vengeful brother-in-law or is this revolt doomed to failure?#!"

While the Khitans are occupied with the Celestial Империя to the south, it is only a matter of time before they return to reassert their influence over the former lands of Balhae. \n\n#bold Will you be able to maintain your independence, or will Jeongan suffer the same fate as its predecessor?#!"

 bookmark_five_dynasties_tang_desc:0 "An adopted son of the second Император of Later Tang, Ли Siyuan, Ли Congke came to power after rebelling against his brother Ли Conghou. Though a reasonably competent ruler, his reign is nevertheless plagued by Khitan raids and natural disasters, calling into question his legitimacy for the Mandate of Heaven. Support has grown for his brother-in-law and rival, Ши Цзинтан, and so the Император had Shi ordered to move from Hedong to Taiping. This only exascerbates Shi's own fears however, and now Shi rises in rebellion against his brother-in-law, with the aid of the Khitans in the north.\n\n#bold Ли Congke's reign has been brief, and it may be about to be cut even shorter. Can you defeat your brother-in-law and keep the name of Tang alive, or will you allow him to supplant you as Император? #!"
